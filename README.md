### **Explanation:**

 **What is a Promise?**

A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It allows you to handle asynchronous operations in a more elegant and structured way, avoiding callback hell and providing a cleaner syntax for chaining asynchronous tasks.

    Below is a Mermaid diagram that visualizes the promise processing flow:

    flowchart TD
    A[Promise Initialization] --> B{Executor Execution}
    B -->|Success| C[resolve Function]
    B -->|Failure| D[reject Function]
    
    C --> E[Set State to FULFILLED]
    E --> F{Has onFulfilled?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Call onFulfilled with Result]
    F -->|No| H[Do Nothing]
    
    D --> I[Set State to REJECTED]
    I --> J{Has onRejected?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Call onRejected with Error]
    J -->|No| L[Do Nothing]
    
    M[then Method] --> N{State is FULFILLED?}
    N -->|Yes| O[Call onFulfilled with Result]
    N -->|No, State is PENDING| P[Store onFulfilled Callback]
    
    Q[catch Method] --> R{State is REJECTED?}
    R -->|Yes| S[Call onRejected with Error]
    R -->|No, State is PENDING| T[Store onRejected Callback]
    ```
